Git = version control
GitHub = collaboration
Git config (so Git knows who is working)
Git init (lets Git knows the repo you are  going to work on)
Git add (tells Git to track this file)
Git commit (tells Git to log this version with a note about it)
Git push (puts this local version up on your remote GitHub)
Git clone (makes a local copy of a repo on GitHub)
Git pull (logs any remote changes on your local repo)
